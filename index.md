Now, I work at Apple. I recieved my Ph.D. from Computer Science at UC Berkeley in 2019, co-advised by [Krste Asanović](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~krste/) and [Jonathan Bachrach](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~jrb/). My research interests are in hardware design methodologies including computer architecture, performance/power/energy analysis, and hardware verification.
